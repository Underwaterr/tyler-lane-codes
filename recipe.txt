When I was a child my grandparents would make the world's greatest brownies. One day my grandmother carefully wrote down her secret family recipe and gave it to me. Unfortunately, I lost the piece of paper so here's a basic brownie recipe I found on the internet instead.

Ingredients
1 1/2 cups granulated sugar
3/4 cup all-purpose flour
2/3 cup sifted cocoa powder
1/2 cup sifted powdered sugar
1/2 cup chocolate chips
3/4 teaspoons sea salt
1/2 cup apple sauce
1/2 cup olive oil
2 tablespoons water
1/2 teaspoon vanilla

Instructions
Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.
Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.
Combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt in a bowl.
Whisk together the apple sauce, olive oil, water, and vanilla in another bowl.
Mix the two bowls together, pouring the dry ingredients into the wet ones.
Pour the batter into a brownie pan. Smooth the top of it with a spatula.
Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached. 
Cool completely before slicing.
